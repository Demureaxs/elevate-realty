# Prisma CLI Commands

## 1. `npx prisma init`

**Explanation:**
Initializes a new Prisma project. This command creates the `prisma` folder with a `schema.prisma` file where you define your database schema, and a `.env` file for environment variables.

## 2. `npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration-name>`

**Explanation:**
Runs the migrations defined in your Prisma schema file against your database. This command is used for local development and will also generate a new migration file based on changes to the `schema.prisma` file. Replace `<migration-name>` with a descriptive name for the migration.

## 3. `npx prisma migrate deploy`

**Explanation:**
Applies pending migrations to the database. This command is used in production environments to deploy schema changes without generating new migrations.

## 4. `npx prisma migrate reset`

**Explanation:**
Drops the database, recreates it, and applies all migrations. This command is useful for resetting your local development database to match your `schema.prisma` file. WARNING: This will delete all existing data!

Generates the Prisma Client based on your schema. You should run this command whenever you make changes to your Prisma schema or update your dependencies.
